#### Experimental Design

We decided to use a full factorial design so that we can estimate any interaction we want from the data. Dropping paper helicopters does not take a long time; $2^4$ configurations was a reasonable drain on our resources (time). We dropped each helicopter configuration four times in a random order. 

#### The Data Collection Part

```{r}
# setup the data matrix
# 1 = high (treatment setting), 0 = low (control) setting
obs = data.frame(
  Rotor_Length = rep(c(rep(0,4), rep(1,4)), 8),
  Leg_Length = rep(c(rep(0,8), rep(1,8)), 4),
  Leg_Width = rep(c(rep(0,16), rep(1,16)), 2),
  Paper_Clip = c(rep(0,32), rep(1,32)),
  time = NA
)
DanielData = obs %>% filter(Paper_Clip == 1)
set.seed(2018)
DropOrder = sample_n(DanielData, 32)
DanielData[as.numeric(rownames(DropOrder)),"time"] = 
  c(1.27,1.45,0.85,1.44,1.56,1.18,1.37,0.95,1.04,1.32,1.26,1.02,1.19,0.92,1.14,0.92,
    1.35,1.16,0.87,0.95,1.05,1.56,1.22,0.92,1.10,1.26,1.17,1.10,1.10,1.10,1.58,0.94)
save(DanielData, file = "daniel-drop-data.Rdata")
obs[33:64,"time"] = DanielData$time
save(obs, file = "full-data.Rdata")
```
